# Release 7: Reflect

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    I was not necessarily struggling with anything, but this session definitely made me sharper at a number of things by making me practice them more. 

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    Merges were greatly clarified for me during this GPS. Pull requests were also made much more clear why they are used and are a great tool for working in teams. Being able to trace each commit that I or my teammate had made and being able to go to specific places to find solutions is a great tool. 

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    I asked my pair for help with syntax and with commands. We asked each other many questions throughout the GPS. It's hard to list them all. We were communicating really well and back and forth. My pair was willing to experiment whenever we weren't sure about something. I asked my guide about conflicts and how big or small they can be. 

* What still confuses you about Git?
    I'm not sure what confuses me about Git right now. Everything I've been shown all makes sense. I know that there is much more out there to learn, but right now, I feel confident about what I've learned. 

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    My first pairing went great! There was definitely some nerves going in because I wasn't sure what to expect, but I found that talking to each other about non-DBC things first really helped humanize each other. This GPS made me excited for my next pairing session. The DBC mindset of experimentation and embrace of confusion feels much more real now that I've interacting with another DBCer.
