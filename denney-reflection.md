#My Reflections on GPS 1.1 


* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? Before the GPS session I was a bit uncertain about merge conflicts, I'd never run into one. Now I understand why they happen and why we prevent them. It was good to see what the file will look like so that I could better understand how to solve it if I run into one ..hopefully not :)

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS? Merge conflicts were clarifed, I also had a question about <remote> that our guide, Tam clarified for me. I feel more comfortable creating and moving around in branches and adding files etc. It was great.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I asked my pair when I was unsure of what command to use, or if I had a question and he would research the answer and help us figure it out. I asked Tam to explain more about what <remote> means. 

* What still confuses you about Git? I think there are just different ways of doing things, and so when someone goes about a command differently, it can be confusing at first. But it is helpful to see someone use a different command to reach the same result. I should push myself to find other ways to do things, or at least be familiar. 

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? It was great! My pair was really fantastic to work with. I was nervous at first, but then it just felt really natural and fun.
